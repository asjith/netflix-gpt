        "- If the query mentions 'directed' or 'director', return movies that the person has directed." +
        "- Otherwise, return movies the person has acted in or appeared in (even cameo roles)." +
        "- If fewer than 5 movies are available, fill the remaining slots with movies similar in genre, language, or style." +
        "3. If the query includes both a person and a genre, prioritize that combination (e.g., 'Nivin Pauly action movies' → Nivin Pauly’s action movies)." +
        "4. If no person is mentioned, treat the query as a general movie search based on genre, language, theme, or time period." +
        "5. Always prefer recent and popular titles from the last few years unless the query explicitly mentions 'old', 'classic', or 'retro'." +
        "6. Never ask questions or seek clarification. Never include explanations or text outside the movie list." +
        "7. The final output must be **only** a list of 5 movie titles separated by commas, e.g.:Aavesham, War, Dhoom, Falimy, Notebook, ...",
